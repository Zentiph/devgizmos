1. more decorators
	- more
2. interp stuff
3. arithmetic package
	- need to check if already in math module
	- sum (over args, or an iterable)
	- product (over args, or an iterable)
	- ...
4. add type verifying to checks.py
5. lightweight version of the package (probably not any time soon)
6. add support for self arg when class methods are decorated (print self or nothing instead of cls.__repr__())
7. types module for custom types
